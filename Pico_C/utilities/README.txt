==CD TO THIS FOLDER BEFORE RUNNING A PROGRAM==

blank.png - blank image for log.py

clouds.png - example image for img2raw

img2raw.java - java script that converts images to header files containing an array of each 32-bit pixel of the image. supply image name as argument

jpeg2h.py - deprecated program that converts every byte of a jpeg to an array in an h file

jpeg2h.java - same as above

log.py - run this program before plugging in the pico (may need to change the COM port in the code). This program will read and display a 320x240 frame generated by the pico and write the raw 16-bit framebuffer data to Pico_C/utilities/log/log.bin

monkey.obj - example .obj for obj2h

obj2h.java - program that converts objs (vertices and faces only, and either ONLY quad or ONLY tri models) to the 3D model format for the 3D renderer in the code. Run this code as follows:

java obj2h.java got [tri|quad]

if you have a tri mesh, run java obj2h.java got tri

the code will generate a got.h file, which must be copied into the Pico_C/lib/3D folder.
